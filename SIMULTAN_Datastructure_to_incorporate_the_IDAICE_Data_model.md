# SIMULTAN Datastructure to incorporate the IDA-ICE Data model

## Digital Twin and data model for dynamic energy simulation

The data model to enable dynamic energy simulations with the plugin is based on the Input needed for the simulation.
While developing the plugin we tried to use already existing data of a reference model (e.g. simple architectural model
information) and expand it where necessary with the information needed for the simulation. Therefor the plugin can be
easily incorporated into an already existing model.

```{warning}
Currently the data model is undergoing a refactoring process. The detailed data model will be explained here after that
 process is finished.
```
