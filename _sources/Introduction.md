# Introduction

## What is the LivingLab-Plugin?

The LivingLab Plugin provides a seamless way to bring real-world data into building simulations. By connecting sensors and external data sources through an API, measurement data can be transferred directly to SIMULTAN. From there, the SIMULTAN model can be exported to IDA-ICE, enabling simulations that are not only precise but also continuously updated with live information. This approach ensures that building models remain closely aligned with actual operating conditions.

## Functionality covered by the IDA-ICE-Plugin

In its current development phase, the plugin offers the following features:

- Fetching live weather- and sensor data
- Processing sensor data
- Comparing actual and target values
- Converting the time index

**Workflow**  
The core functionality of the plugin is a fully automated workflow that processes measured weather and sensor data all the way through to simulating the model in IDA-ICE.

**Import / Export**  
The plugin enables smooth data transfer both within and outside the software. Simulation results can be imported from IDA-ICE, and the data model can be exported with integrated live weather and sensor data.
