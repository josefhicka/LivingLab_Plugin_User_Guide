# Getting started with the IDA-ICE Plugin

## Installing the SIMULTAN-Editor

To use the plugin you need to install the latest version of the SIMULTAN Editor, which can be
found <strike>here</strike><!-- Da fehtl etwas -->. The SIMULTAN Editor enables you to interact
with the SIMULTAN data model through a user interface. A comprehensive user-guide how to install and interact with the
SIMULTAN Editor can be found under this [link](https://github.com/bph-tuwien/SIMULTAN.Documentation/wiki).

## Installing the IDA-ICE Plugin

After installing the SIMULTAN Editor you can install the IDA-ICE Plugin via the Plugin Manager {numref}`plugin_manager`.
Either download <!-- Aktualisiert -->the plugin from the SIMULTAN Server, `Plugin-Name: IDAICEPlugin`<!-- HinzugefÃ¼gt -->, or install from your local disk with the
installation file.

```

When the installation was successful a new tab will be added to your taskbar named `IDA ICE Plugin`
{numref}`idaice_plugin`. If Simultan is set to German, you can find it under the name `Neuer Ribbon Tab` at the moment.
