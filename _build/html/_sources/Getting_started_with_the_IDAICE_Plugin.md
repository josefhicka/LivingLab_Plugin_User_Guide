# Getting started with the LivingLab Plugin

## Installing the SIMULTAN-Editor
To use the plugin you need to install the latest version of the SIMULTAN Editor. The SIMULTAN Editor enables you to interact with the SIMULTAN data model through a user interface. A comprehensive user-guide how to install and interact with the SIMULTAN Editor can be found under this [link](https://github.com/bph-tuwien/SIMULTAN.Documentation/wiki).

## Installing the LivingLab Plugin
To install the LivingLab plugin correctly, follow the step-by-step instructions.

1. Start your SIMULTAN application
2. Open the following tab: `General`
3. There is an area for options within the General tab. Click on the `Plugins&Updates` button with the puzzle piece icon (see {numref}`download_instructions`) to open this feature.

5. Under the add option, you can now finally add any existing plugin. All you need is the `Plugin-Name`. This option makes it very easy and straightforward to add new plugins (see {numref}`Plugin_add`).

6. After pressing the Install button, the plugin should now be successfully installed. SIMULTAN will now ask you to restart the app. When the app reopens, a new tab called LivingLab should appear.


## Run the example
To check if everything was installed properly please open install_test_model.simultan from the examples provided where you downloaded the installation file of the plugin. Open the example in your SIMULTAN Editor (username and password is “admin”), and follow the instructions in the chapter Running a simulation. If this works fine and you are getting plausible results the installation was successful.
