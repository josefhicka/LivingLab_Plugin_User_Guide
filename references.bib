  abstract = {The way people work has changed and many corporate real estate (CRE) and facility managers (FM) are thinking about whether and how to implement smart-building applications in the work environments of their client. The data collected by these applications can be a valuable asset, however it is necessary to identify beforehand which type of data collection could provide which strategic value(s). Therefore, this study examined the expected strategic value of specific smart work environment applications for organizations from the perspective of CRE and FM professionals. A questionnaire was developed based on existing literature. In total, 122 CRE and FM experts participated and provided their perception of 20 different applications and 9 different strategic values. During follow-up expert interviews, the practical implications of the findings were discussed and translated into recommendations. The smart applications that are expected to decrease real estate costs mostly relate to the automatization of facility services. Employee satisfaction is particularly supported by smart applications related to personal preferences and personalization (e.g. temperature control, smart coffee machine). The smart applications that are expected to support productivity mostly concerned either features of the work environment (automatic printer and meeting room allocation), ways to eliminate negative conditions (noise cancelling), or support in finding colleagues elsewhere in the building. Although many studies have proven the effect of physical work environment characteristics on employees and/or on organizations, there is little insight into the effect of smart work environment applications on both. This paper has started to build theory on smart building applications. The findings in this paper are also relevant for CRE and facility managers and consultants as they provide insight in what their colleagues expect of different available smart work environment technology applications, to support their own decision making},

  abstract = {The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the continuous use of digital construction models from the planning stage onwards. The affected processes are iterative and involve multiple stakeholders who work at varying pace and in varying levels of detail. These stakeholders require highly specific tools based on diverging data models. To satisfy all those requirements one of the best known Open BIM implementations \textendash{} IFC \textendash{} offers a data model containing more than one thousand different types \textendash{} from basic to highly specific. Due to its complexity, potential users must undergo prolonged training. The even bigger challenge for IFC, however, is keeping up with the updates of building regulations or with the ever expanding state of the art in simulation tools. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC, consist of 26 different basic types. They can be combined to increasingly complex models, which can themselves be used as types for other models. This enables each domain expert to create a custom data structure for any specific task, which is automatically compatible with the data structure of any other domain expert using the same basic types. It shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-, and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key aspect of BIM. As a use case, we present the calculation of the U-Value of a multi-layered wall. We compare number, complexity and adequacy of the necessary data modelling steps in IFC4 and in SIMULTAN. The result shows that the flexible data model of SIMULTAN can be better adapted to the task. Another significant advantage of SIMULTAN is its inbuilt separation of responsibilities at the level of the most basic types, which, when combined with secure transaction technologies, can enable safe, effective and easily traceable interaction among stakeholders.},

Due to its complexity, potential users must undergo prolonged training. The even bigger challenge for IFC, however, is keeping up with the updates of building regulations or with the ever expanding state of the art in simulation tools. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC, consists of approximately 30 different basic types. They can be combined to increasingly complex models, which can themselves be used as types for other models. This enables each domain expert to create a custom data structure for any specific task, which is automatically compatible with the data structure of any other domain expert using the same basic types. It shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-, and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key aspect of BIM.  As a proof-of-concept we show the application of our data model in an ongoing project. We demonstrate the completeness of our data model and the fulfillment of the requirements of the design phase.
